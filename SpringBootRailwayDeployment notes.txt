I followed this tutorial:
    Spring Boot Railway: How to deploy a Spring Boot application to Railway
        https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5sVxvF47dcU

If you run Application, it will also start a PostgreSql DB  docker container...and you can then open the browser
and navigate to http://localhost:8080/api/posts to see the posts that were inserted in the DB from posts.json.

This app is configured in application.yml to run with "prod" profile, so that the configuration data from
application-prod.yml is used when deployed on Railway. Don't commit with "dev" as the app deployed on Railway will probably
not work anymore.

To see the app link go in your Railway account, click on the github app, go to settings and obtain the custom link.
When entering in the browser remember to add /api/posts etc, depending on what request you are making.
Example of link (this is not working...it is dummy link): https://myApp-pro-7804.up.railway.app
